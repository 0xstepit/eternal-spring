	__Eternal Spring__ is a blog about the _random things_ I learn and experiment 
	with related to mathematics and cryptography.


	I'm Stefano, a software engineer based in Berlin. I'm interested in distributed systems,
	decentralized finance, and all the math around them.

	I'm currently working as a blockchain engineer at ([Noble Core](https://github.com/noble-assets/noble)),
	where we are building public infrastructure for world payments. In the past years I designed and developed
	architecture for cross-chain communication systems ([Orbiter](https://github.com/noble-assets/orbiter)), 
	on decentralized finance application for stablecoins, and on a porting of the Ethereum Virtual Machine 
	for the Cosmos SDK (([evmos](https://github.com/evmos/evmos)). The systems I worked on facilitated
	over 50M in stablecoins transfer and over 1B in exchanged volumes.

	Before developing my passion for computers and finance, I did research at the intersection
	of machine-learning and aerospace structural analysis. I was fascinated by instability
	phenomena in cylindrical shapes, and how to efficiently
	optimize them without solving complex non-linear equations. I spent around 1 year during my
	PhD implementing [feed-forward neural nets](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compstruct.2019.111513)
	combined with bio-inspired optimization algorithms, like the particle swarm optimization. After 
	the first year, I dropped out.


	Work stuff aside, I love martial arts.
	I practiced Judo for around 13 years, and I'm now a second-dan black belt. When I was 18,
	I placed [3rd at the Italian championships](https://judoinside.com/judoka/96874/Stefano_Pitton/judo-career).
	If you’ve never tried judo, I strongly recommend it!
	From Japan to China, I recently started studying Kung Fu, specifically the Wing Chun lineage
	from Leung Ting.
