	__Eternal Spring__ is a blog about the _random things_ I learn and experiment with.
	I like taking notes, even for very short concepts, so, expect to find writing, notes,
	and fragments on software, math, and martial arts.


	I'm Stefano, a software engineer based in Berlin.
	I'm interested in distributed systems,
	decentralized finance, and all the math around them.

	I mainly work on open-source projects,
	and in the past years I contributed to the first stablecoin chain ([Noble Core](https://github.com/noble-assets/noble)),
	a Cosmos SDK module to expose go-ethereum EVM ([evmos](https://github.com/evmos/evmos), [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk)),
	and a bunch of other _interesting things_,
	in particular an abstraction layer on top of cross-chain bridges
	like IBC, CCTP, and Hyperlane called [Orbiter](https://github.com/noble-assets/orbiter).
	

	Before developing my passion for computers and finance, I did research at the intersection
	of machine-learning and aerospace structural analysis. I was fascinated by instability
	phenomena in cylindrical shapes and how to efficiently
	optimize them without solving complex non-linear equations. It was incredible to
	realize, despite the math being quite clear, that an instability phenomena can create
	artistic shapes. Art in destruction, or destruction in the art? I spent around 1 year during my
	PhD implementing [feed-forward neural nets](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compstruct.2019.111513)
	combined with bio-inspired optimization algorithms, like the particle swarm optimization. Why only 1
	year? Well, I dropped out :).


	Work stuff aside, I love martial arts, and one day I dream of opening my own gym.
	I practiced Judo for around 13 years.
	When I was 18, I placed [3rd at the Italian championships](https://judoinside.com/judoka/96874/Stefano_Pitton/judo-career),
	and I hold a second-dan black belt. If you’ve never tried judo, I strongly recommend it!
	From Japan to China, I recently started studying Kung Fu, specifically the Wing Chun lineage
	from Leung Ting.
