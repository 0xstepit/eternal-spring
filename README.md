# `eternalspring`

Eternal Spring is a blog about the random things I learn and experiment
with during my work and free time. Expect to find writing, notes, and
fragments on software design, decentralized finance applications, math,
and martial arts.

## Usage

The project uses [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as the package manager:

```sh
yarn install
```

Run the project locally:

```sh
yarn run dev
```

The website will be available at `http://localhost:4321/`.

## TODO

The project is still a WIP, expect many changes to the codebase, but not to the style.

- [ ] Add a tag page
- [ ] Clean all the nightmare in the `global.css` file. Seriously,
      don't look at it.
- [ ] Fzf for writing searching
- [ ] SEO optmiziation.
- [ ] Deployment without Netlify.
- [ ] Create an opensource template to share and move to another
      repo the personal stuff.
